    """Probability model for MCMC.

    This class defines the probability models used for MCMC, keeps track of the
    dataset, and sets up several constant parameters that don't vary with the
    orbital model used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`
        A numpy array of ppv data points.

        Each data point is itself a list of the form [ra, dec, vel], where ra
        and dec are the right ascension and declination, respectively, in
        radians, while vel is the recessional velocity in units of km/s, and is
        based on the moment 1 map of the original data cube, which is itself an
        intensity weighted average of the gas velocity at each sky position.
    space : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`
        A 2-d array of floats that gives the bounds of the model parameter
        space, where the first axis represents the axes of the parameter space,
        while the 2nd axis are the minimum and maximum values of the parameter
        space axes.

    Attributes
    ----------
    data : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`
        A numpy array of ppv data points. This is the same dataset that each
        `Model` object should be instantiated with.
    cov : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`
        The covariance matrix of `data`.
    inv_cov : :obj:`numpy.ndarray`
        The inverse of `cov`.
